# 🎯 **Call Plan: GloriaFood-Loyverse Integration**

## **Client: Moe Fareh**

## **📞 Call Structure (30-45 minutes)**

### **Opening (2-3 minutes)**
**"Hi Moe, thanks for making time. I've researched both APIs and have a clear plan to give you the same seamless experience you get with Shipday."**

---

## **🔍 Phase 1: Problem Confirmation (5 minutes)**

### **Listen & Take Notes**
**"Walk me through your typical day with online orders"**

**Key Questions to Ask:**
- "So when a customer orders online, what's the first thing that happens?"
- "Who's responsible for typing that into Loyverse?"
- "How long does it typically take per order?"
- "What happens if you're in the middle of a rush?"
- "How many online orders do you get daily?"

### **Rephrase Their Pain (Make Them Feel It)**
**"Let me make sure I understand your situation..."**

**Rephrase Examples:**
- **"So every time someone orders online, your staff has to stop what they're doing and manually type everything into Loyverse?"**
- **"And this happens multiple times per day, taking 5-10 minutes each time?"**
- **"So you're essentially paying someone to be a data entry clerk instead of serving customers?"**

**Make It Emotional:**
- **"That's like having a full-time employee just copying information from one system to another"**
- **"Every minute spent typing is a minute not spent on food quality or customer service"**
