# üçï **Simple Plan: Fix Your Order Problem**

## **Your Problem (Brief)**
- **GloriaFood** = Online ordering system (customers order online)
- **Loyverse** = Your POS system (where you process orders)
- **Current Issue**: Every online order must be manually typed into Loyverse
- **Result**: Staff wastes time, orders get delayed, customers get frustrated

## **My Solution (Simple)**
**I'll build a server that automatically connects GloriaFood to Loyverse**

## **What I Will Do (Step by Step)**

### **Step 1: Build the Connection**
- Create a server that talks to both GloriaFood and Loyverse
- When GloriaFood gets an order, it automatically sends it to Loyverse
- No more manual typing needed

### **Step 2: Set Up Everything**
- Deploy the server on your system
- Connect it to your GloriaFood account
- Connect it to your Loyverse account
- Test with real orders

### **Step 3: You're Done**
- Orders now flow automatically
- Staff just review and finalize
- Save 2-3 hours daily
- Save $1,500+ monthly

## **What You Need to Give Me**
1. **GloriaFood API key** (from your dashboard)
2. **Loyverse access token** (from your dashboard)
3. **Loyverse location ID**
4. **Server/domain** where I can deploy this

## **Timeline**
- **Week 1**: Build and deploy
- **Week 2**: Test and configure
- **Week 3**: Go live

## **Result**
**Online orders automatically appear in your POS - no more manual work!**
